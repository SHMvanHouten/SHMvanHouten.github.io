Welcome back to learning Java!
This week we discussed input/output streams. The code for this weeks lesson can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/SHMvanHouten/javatraining/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/shmvanhouten/lesson5/HelloWorld.java/" target="_blank">here</a>
A great resource I used as well to write this entry is the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/index.html" target="_blank">Java Tutorials page on basic I/O</a><br>
<br>
<h3> The File class and File Output Stream</h3>
The first thing we take a look at is writing a file.<br>
First we have to give a path to the file. What we use for that is the File class:
<pre>
File file = new File("C:\\Users\\Sjoerd","sjoerd.txt")
</pre>
What we could use is just the most basic FileOutputStream. This will copy our data one byte at a time if implemented
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/bytestreams.html" target="_blank"> this way</a><br>
<pre>
private static void writeAFile() throws IOException{
   File file = new File("/home/sjoerd/Documents","sjoerd.txt");
   FileOutputStream fos = null;
   try {
       fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
       file.createNewFile();// this will make the file if it doesn’t exist yet.
       fos.write("Hello World!\n".getBytes());
   } finally{
       if(fos != null){
           fos.close();
       }
   }
}
</pre>
Because the FileOutputStream only accepts single bytes as input we have to give it the String “Hello World!\n" in byte format by using the getBytes() method from the String API.
As you can see we had make the writeAFile() method <a id="linkToChapter4" onclick="goToChapter4()">throw an IO exception</a> because the close method throws an IO exception which is of course a checked exception.<br>
<br>
<h3>try-with-resources</h3>
The first thing we can do is get rid of that finally block. It is necessary to close the File Output Stream because it could cause resource leaks but we can do it more neatly by using a try-with-resources block.<br>
<pre>
private static void writeAFile(){
   File file = new File("/home/sjoerd/Documents","sjoerd.txt");
   try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);){
       file.createNewFile();
       fos.write("Hello World!\n".getBytes());
   } catch (IOException e){
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
}
</pre>
the resource you put in the parentheses after try will be closed automatically when the try block has been finished.<br>
Now we can also catch the IOException from the .close() method too so we don’t have to throw it anymore.<br>
<br>
<h3>Character Stream IO: PrintWriter</h3>
Byte streams are really low lvl I/O that won't be very efficient to use. For our purposes we need to use a character stream. All character streams descend from reader and writer. PrintWriter is also useful because it can use the println method. Let's add it to see it in action:<br>
<pre>
private static void writeAFile() {
   File file = new File("C:\\Users\\Sjoerd","sjoerd.txt");
   try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file); PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fos)){
       file.createNewFile();
       fos.write("Hello World!\n".getBytes());
       pw.println("why doesn't world say anything back?" + System.currentTimeMillis());
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
}
</pre>
You can use the FileOutPutStream as an argument for the Printwriter constructor or you can use the File. Now let's have a look at Input Streams.<br>
<br>
<h3>Input Streams and Buffered Streams</h3>
The output equivalent of the basic output stream is FileInputStream.<br>
<pre>
private static String[] readAFile2() {
   File file = new File("C:\\Users\\Sjoerd","sjoerd.txt");
   try(FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file)) {
       int read = fis.read();
       System.out.println(read);
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return null;
}
// the output is 72.
</pre>
Because FileInputStream is a byte-stream it gives 8 bit values, in this case 72. This represents the capital letter H on the ASCII table. Not very efficient so let's use something more sophisticated.
<pre>
private static String[] readAFile() {
   File file = new File("C:\\Users\\Sjoerd","sjoerd.txt");
   try(BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file))) {
       String readLine = reader.readLine();

       while(readLine != null){
           System.out.println(readLine);
           readLine = reader.readLine();
       }

   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return null;
}
</pre>
Here we see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/buffers.html" target="_blank">BufferedReader</a> which adds efficiency.<br>
System.out is also a stream which doesn't need to be opened and is defined automatically, same as System.err and System.in.<br>
<br>
<h3>Terminal Input </h3>
Because System.in is already defined we can use it to read our input we give in the console:
<pre>
private static void readFromTerminalInput() {
   InputStream in = System.in;
   InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(in);
   try(BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(isr)){
       String readLine = reader.readLine();
       while(readLine != null){
           System.out.println(readLine);
           readLine = reader.readLine();
       }
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
}
</pre>
I made a little number guessing game to mess around with what we learned this week. It ca be found <a href="https://github.com/SHMvanHouten/javatraining/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/shmvanhouten/lesson5/NumberGame.java" target="_blank">here</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/SHMvanHouten/javatraining/blob/master/src/test/java/com/github/shmvanhouten/lesson5/NumberGameTest.java" target="_blank">test here</a><br>
<h3>Intellij IDEA stuff</h3>
We had a look at the features intellij has for our tests. We had a look at running test with coverage. When you run a test with coverage you can see how much of your classes are covered by your tests. A very useful feature.<br>
Another thing we looked at again was using the debug feature, where you can set a breakpoint in your code and hop through the running of the code line by line to see exactly how your code runs.<br>
We also learned the hotkey ctrl alt l, to reformat your code to be lined out and tabbed in properly.<br>
<br>
That is what we looked at this week. Our next lesson will handle Databases.
